### Real-time Support

If anything goes wrong ask the instructors for help. Some of our core devs will also be on standby on [Discord](https://discord.gg/E3YrVtG) during the workshop (usually they can be quite nice and helpful).

## Part 1: The Smart Contract Secure SDLC

We'll start with a little bit of theory (sorry guys, it can't all be fun and games). [Tom Lindeman](https://twitter.com/EtherDotBlue) explains Secure SDLC Processes. He's not a coder like the rest of us, so please be gentle and don't ask him any hard technical questions.

This info graphic sums things up pretty nicely.

## Part 2: Threat Modeling

Before buidling a smart contract system you should think about potential threats and countermeasures In this section of the workshop, [Gerhard Wagner](https://twitter.com/g3rh4rdw4gn3r) gives an overview on threat modeling. As an exercise, you'll then build a mini-threat-model for your own app or sample app. The [presentation slides](slides/How_to_Not_Get_Rekt_Part_1_Threat_Modeling.pdf) contain further instructions.
